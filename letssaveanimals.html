Peoples are using animals for their ivory, their comfort and food. Now days we are cutting trees. By cutting trees only, animals are dying. Save wildlife and save forest!</p>

    <p id="heading">Save Animals and Wildlife 
    </p>
    <p id="r0">Here are five reasons to save wildlife:
    </p>
    <p id="para1"> 1. Promotes pollination and continuity of native plant species
Small animals particularly bees, insects, butterflies, and birds play an important role in food production. Conservation of these animals, therefore, aid in pollination. Since they depend on nectar from flowers, they are vital in crop production, inter-cropping, and promoting the continuity of native plant species. By moving from one flower to another in search of nectar, bees carry pollen by sustaining the process of crop growth.

    </img>
<p id="para2"> 2. Medicinal value
Although plants are the major sources of medications, some animals are also vital in the production of medications. For example, the venom from cobra is an important ingredient in making the medications for leprosy while lobsters can be used as antifungals.

    </img>
<p id="para3"> 3. Aesthetic benefits
Watching animals in their natural habitat is not only fun, but also relaxing. People always go for holidays in areas under conservation such as zoos, game parks, lakes, oceans, forests, and mountains for activities such as camping, fishing, boat riding, and hiking just to mention a few.

    </img>
<p id="para4"> 4. Its fun and entertaining!
People spend hours on their television watching wild animals’ documentaries as their source of fun and entertainment. Failing to conserve wildlife and their habitat will mean that there will be no more animal documentation and thus, lack of entertainment. Furthermore, watching animals on their natural habitat, for example, watching predators make a kill in the jungle is highly enthralling.

</img>
<p id="para5"> 5. Preserves heritage and culture
Conserving wildlife means conserving heritage and traditional culture. Some places are known for their flora and fauna in relation to the native practices and ways of livelihood, which means that failing to conserve the environment, will lead to loss of their land and native heritage.

       <p><b>
      Reason:5 Restore. Habitat destruction is the main threat to 85 percent of all threatened and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. You can help reduce this threat by planting native trees, restoring wetlands or cleaning up beaches in your area.
